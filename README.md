## Why
I'm doing a personal challenge, which is to create 10 projects, proposed by Felipe Deschamps in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYR9L2ZmodM).

This is the "Something that uses external API" project.

- Rich-text editor
- Monitor-like Activity Monitor from macOS
- Apple Music or Spotify app
- Calendar
- Show and filters repository on Github
- [x] [Something that uses external API](https://github.com/gustavonovaes/breaking-bad-cast)
